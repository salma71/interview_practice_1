| function name | what does it do | example
| ------ | ------ | ------
| `dist(x, y)` | get the euclidean distance between two given points |  ```math.dist([0, 3, 15], [0,  3, )``` -> 225.0
| `pow(x, y)` | square x to the power of y | 
| `hypot(*coord)` | returns the distance from origin to givin coord - euclidean norm, also can find the intercept distance of a point | ``` p1 = (5,5)``` ``` distance = math.hypot((p1[0], p1[1])``` -> 7.07
